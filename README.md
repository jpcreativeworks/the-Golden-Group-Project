# the-Golden-Group-Project

This project started out with inspiration from the Golden Girls television show. During one of our developers time, Jenn, as a captioning agent for the hard of hearing, a lot of the clients were customers were elderly like the Golden Girls and tend to forget information. So that is where the insiration for a super simpler user friendly site to help users do one of their most favorite past times, watching movies.  

So Shady Pines Cinema is a website that is all about the movies! Our Golden Group first settled on an api that seemed like it checked all of the boxes called Data-IMBD. The api was plentiful of information, when it was tested it would return information, presented our ideas to our advisors and recieved approval. So we started building our ideas of possiblities for our concept for Shady Pines Cinema as an actual site

## Shady Pines Cinema

The initial goal was to help users research films by four popular imputs, Film title, actor name, rating, and genre. Then when the user hit search, it would generate a card with that information plus a poster icon of that film with the option to add to a local watch list. 

The watch list would then have an ability to favorite or remove movies. Then it would help the usuer remember if they had watched a movie, if it was their favorite, if they would watch it again.

## Process


We had Samantha on for helping out with the html and putting together the slides for the presentation. Jenn was assigned bootstrap-styling/css attributes, and Brant and Lawson put their heads together to tackle the javascript and jquery attributes.

We started with having Samantha put together the html skeleton code, while Jenn created a vecotor logo for the site and begin classing the css style sheet with :root elements and class names for common styling. All the while Brant and Lawson came together to shape the .fetch and eventListeners to generate the information we wanted to render on page from the API.

As the project progress we maintained communication, every member would pick up where needed to contribute or research to find the information needed to solve the issue. The group would all come to an agreement and then instantly move forward and start implementing. Definately a hard working and dedicated group.

## Challenges

This project started off with promise and hope. We used to laugh and smile. By the end we wanted to quit and start a band together, although we are all hardworking and everyone did as much as possible to get this off the ground there was a lot of challenges.  

One of the requirements for this project was to use a bootstrap/css method that didn't involve bootstrap. After reviewing the responsivness to the other options such as Skeleton, Bootflat, and Groundwork, the demos were not all that impressive and as diverse as we wanted them to be without being confusting. Then we discovered bulma.io to be a great option for what we wanted the site to use and the clean contemperary look. The only problem was that it wasn't so much language based in css, but language that is created put in the classes in the html and it renders on the page. 

This caused some conflit issues when both Sam and Jenn were working in the same file, they both had to stay in consistant communication so not to over write each others work and make sure that all pushes and pulls were coming thru properly with all the updates. To keep from any major mishaps occuring we kept a hard copy of the files on Jenn's desktop as a final back up. 

There was the challenge of pushing and pulling the files as a group within the terminal. The terminal is its own beast. We had a lot of issues with our branches and files not wanting to merge and merging them incorrectly and that would lead to getting stuck in the terminal with a bunch of work that is finished and not knowing what to do. So we would have to wait until we could get further assistance before we could debug what was wrong and you can't learn how to get out of a problem in the terminal until you have gotten into that problem. Now complie that issue to every group member have an issue every day with the terminal and it eats up a lot of time and makes everyone feel less confident using the terminal due the potential challenge because of how much of a headache it was. 

Another challenge that we faced was that the original api that we decided to go with and was approved by our superiors, was a free api, and had unlimitied amount of pulls and was returning information in the demo, just wasn't working when doing the fetch. it wasn't returning any information, just a lot of empty arrays. we tried using a different api that searched the keyword, then that would return some things but it was inconsistant, then we tried four differnt searches that called just to that one item from the api. Still no success, for three days of consulting with our teacher and ta and not figuring it out. 

finally we decided to change the api to a totally new api called OMBD API, this one had the similar information that we neede but it wasn't working and returning a 404. When Jenn asked her tutor she shared the 404 hack that was able to by pass that issue. If she wasn't taught that hack by someone outside the classroom it would have been an quite the challenge to figure that out. 

Lastly since we had so many issues backing up our progress, this caused delays in the further development and testing of the advanced features of the site. 

## Overall

This was very hard and wish we had more time to work on it. It is unfortunate that we can not just instantly upload the knowledge for code into our minds and impliment it correctly and perfectly and quickly everytime. Failures and Challenges is where the most learning is done. So this site to some may be views as a failure because we did not impliment all of our goals and we did not have more than one API working. But we did learn our strengths, weaknesses and built upon those while working as the Golden Group.
